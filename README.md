# 1. Introduction
This project is to assess the coding abilities and style of an applicant for the role of Perl/Python Developer

Two Sample data files, one CSV and the other is XML have been provided as the input to the process.

A MySQL CREATE TABLE script has also been included.

This is what is required.

1. Create a program (or programs) in Perl/Python that takes the CSV OR XML file and imports it into the SQL table

2. Create a web page to perform CRUD on the imported data also in Perl/Python

Use any framework you want, please write tests. Please don't spend more than 4 hours, completing this task. If you haven't finished after that timeframe, feel free to submit what you have.

# 2. Input file formats
Two input data files have been provided for this test. Both of these files contain similar data. However the XML file contains some additional information.

 * users_list.csv
 * users_list.xml

 Your program only needs to import one or the other (you don't need to import both)

# 3. Assumptions
  * we don't need to buy or install any external software. your code should work with minimum requirements
  * Include any instructions on how to run your application if it is not obvious
